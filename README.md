# CountryByIp

## Task 1 - Laravel Country by IP

In this test scenario a Laravel app needs to know the country of every visitor on
every page. Use a geolocation-by-IP API service to get this information (like
http://geoiplookup.net). Make good use of server resources! Follow Laravel
best-practices (hint: use a middleware).

## Task 2 - Develop a script for modal dialog boxes in ES6 javascript and CSS.

Develop your own script for showing modal boxes for dialogs and notifications that
uses plain javascript and css. The script should be abstract (implementable for
multiple modals within the same page, both on user interaction (i.e. click) and
dynamically). You have to create methods for showing and closing the box, as well as
listeners to activate on page-load and on click.
